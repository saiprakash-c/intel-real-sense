# Intel Realsense LCM driver 

Inteal Realsense LCM driver connects to a Realsense device and publishes RGB and depth images as LCM messages.  

The driver is tested only with Realsense D435 in Ubuntu 18.04. But it should work for any D400 series device. The lcmtypes of RGB and depth images are in `lcmtypes` folder. The channels for RGB and depth images are **RGB_DATA_CHANNEL** and **DEPTH_DATA_CHANNEL** repsectively.
